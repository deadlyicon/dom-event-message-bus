# DomEventMessageBus


Chrome extensions are allowed to run custom javascript on pages
you visit. This syncronus message bus allows you to pass simple
objects back and forth. It also supports promises with a
timeout.

It's currently built for exactly what I need it to do but I'll
happily checkout forks and pulll requests if anyone needs
something similar.
